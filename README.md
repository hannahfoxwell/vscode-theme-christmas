# Christmas Theme for Visual Studio Code

As a month, December is a litle different to most. We must fell small trees and cover them in glitter, we must eat our weight in chocolate and we must dig out the obligatory Christmas jumpers from the back of our wardrobes where they have rested undisturbed for the other 11 months.

And yet, I find myself gazing at a screen with no evidence of the festive glee that surrounds me. 

Whilst the idea of synax highlighting has existed for longer than I have, no one has yet decorated their code in the colours of the season. 

My gift to the world this Christmas is a unashamedly festive colourising theme to literally light up your code like a Christmas Tree. Enjoy!

## This theme is great for...
- Pair programming with the office grinch
- Delighting your Product Owner at demo time
- Constructing a festive to do list in Ruby
- Coordinate your code with a Christmas jumper 
- Updating your blog with a festive kitten and well wishes for your 3 followers
- Sending Santa your Christmas list in JSON via his new API (Why doesn't this exist yet?)

## This theme is not great for...
- People who are colour blind. Sorry. I guess Christmas time must be a struggle for you. I blame Santa.
